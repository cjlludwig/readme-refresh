You are an AI assistant tasked with standardizing and improving a project's `README.md` file using the structured format below.

### Objectives:
- Reuse existing content from the current README where appropriate.
- Do not fabricate content. Only use information that can be confidently derived from the repo.
- Do not include any response other than the `README.md`

Your output should be a fully rewritten `README.md` file, formatted according to the structure provided and grounded in real project context.
